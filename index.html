    <h1>TREASURE HUNT</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to Treasure Hunt! Hundreds of years ago, a rich king buried millions of dollars worth of treasure. He told nobody where he buried it, but you found a map of a secret cave in the Land of Treasureville which you believe leads to the treasure. When you're ready to enter the cave, press begin. </p>
  <br>
  <p>At each point, you will be asked to choose one of two options. Each choice will determine the path you take and may even decide your fate. Choose wisely. Enter at your own risk...</p>
