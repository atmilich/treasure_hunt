    <h1>TREASURE HUNT</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Congradulations, you have killed the beast! Next to the dead body, you found a vial of purple liquid. You lick your parched lips and ask yourself if drinking the mysterious liquid will be worth the risk. If you don't drink it, you could be too dehydrated to continue.

  <p> Drink or don't drink? </p>
